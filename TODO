Use thrift for an IPC server; compile to scala with https://github.com/twitter/scrooge

* Update the server's copy of a textbox in its 'onblur' event.
* Locally track which textbox id number we're in using its 'onfocus' event.
* Provide a 'run' button that:
  * updates the server's copy of the textbox most recently onblur'd.
  * actually run the code.
  * update the client's copy of the output.

* save and restore notebooks.

* shift-enter should run the current text box
* add a button / menu item to add a new text area after the current one.
* if it's the last textbox, add a new one.
